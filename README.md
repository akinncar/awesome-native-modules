## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a mobile app with React Native, and implement some Native Modules and Native Components.

## Technologies

To develop this application, a React Native App was created with Javascript using `npx react-native init`, and some modules are being implemented for iOS and Android with Objective-C, Swift, and Java. The implementatios are based on [popular react native libraries made by community](https://reactnative.directory/). 

## Features

This board shows what features are available and what features are in the development stage and will be implemented soon:
